# BlazorLottoApp

This is a Blazor application for a lottery system.

## Technology Stack
This was written using .net 8 and Blazor Server.
I opted for this option as the requirement for using Maui was to only use native APIs and controls. Therefore I went with a .net web solution and used Razor pages.

## Features

- Pick random numbers for the lottery.
- Check if the picked numbers are winners.
- Display results in a user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later with Blazor support
